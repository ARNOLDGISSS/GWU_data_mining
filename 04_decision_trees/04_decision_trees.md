## Section 04: Decision Trees

Decision trees strike a nice balance between interpretability and accuracy. They pick up on nonlinearity and high degree interactions, but they still produce simple rules or diagrams that explain their decisions. They're also a very robust modeling technique that can generally accept missing values, variables of disparate scales, and correlated variables.
