##	Section 08: Text Mining

Text mining essentially means converting a group of documents into a meaningful numeric representation (i.e. data set). This data set can be joined with more standard structured data or be left on its own, and then statistical or machine learning analysis is conducted on this data set for inferential or predictive purposes.
