## Section 02: Analytical Data Prep

A great deal of work in data mining projects is spent on data munging. Below some common problems are listed along with their symptoms and potential solutions.

Problem | Symptoms | Solution
--- | --- | ---
**Incomplete data** | Useless models and meaningless results. | Get more data. Get better data.
**Biased Data** | Biased models and biased, inaccurate results. | Get more data. Get better data.
**Wide Data** | Long, intolerable compute times. Meaningless results due to curse of dimensionality. |
**Sparse Target Variable** | Single class model predictions. Biased model predictions. |
**Dirty Data** | Biased models and biased, inaccurate results. Long, intolerable compute times. Unstable parameter estimates and rule generation. Unreliable out-of-domain predictions. |
**Outliers** | Biased models and biased, inaccurate results. Unstable parameter estimates and rule generation. Unreliable out-of-domain predictions. |
**Missing Values** | Information loss. Biased models and biased, inaccurate results. |
**High Cardinality Categorical Variables** | Over-fit models and inaccurate results. Long, intolerable compute times. Unreliable out-of-domain predictions. |
**Disparate Variable Scales** | Unreliable parameter estimates, biased models, and biased, inaccurate results. |
Strong Multicollinearity (correlation) | Unstable parameter estimates, rule generation, and predictions. |
